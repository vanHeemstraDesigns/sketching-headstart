Based on "SKETCHING For Beginners: 5 TIPS for Drawing Like a Pro (with Examples!)" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yRw1zWTPx4

Sketching with a tablet isn't easy!

But it doesn't have to be so hard... In this beginner's tutorial, I'll be showing you some of the best tips & tricks that completely changed the way I draw, including:

- âœ” How to "train your eye" to spot mistakes in your drawings
- âœ” 5 tips that will make your sketches look way more accurate (no more wonky drawings!)
- âœ” How to use the power of positive and negative space to improve your drawings
- âœ” How to use geometric shapes, angles, alignment, and a number of other powerful techniques to help push your style and create beautiful, professional-looking sketches (yes, even on your tablet!)

I hope you find them useful, and I can't wait to see your results!

And as usualâ€¦ happy painting ðŸŽ¨
